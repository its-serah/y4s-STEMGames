            <h2>Why You’ll Love It</h2>
            <p>If you enjoy solving puzzles and thinking your way through challenges, or if you love programming (or are just starting to learn it), then this game is for you.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Concepts Explored</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game introduces algorithms and control flow as you sequence actions with loops and conditionals.</li>
                <li>You learn to manage state and decompose big goals into smaller functions for planting, watering, and harvesting.</li>
                <li>You practice automation and optimization by replacing manual grind with efficient, resource aware scripts.</li>
                <li>You develop debugging and iteration habits by changing code, observing drone behavior, and refining your approach.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learn:</strong> The fundamental concept of automation.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Basics of Python and increasing code complexity as new gameplay elements are introduced.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Logical thinking to develop autonomous harvesting algorithms that adapt to expanding environments and obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage:</strong> Problem solving and debugging skills by testing and refining player written scripts to achieve optimal efficiency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
            <p>In The Farmer Was Replaced you use a simple Python based programming language to program an agricultural drone and harvest crops. As you progress, your landscape expands, new crops appear, and obstacles can block your way. Over time, the game gives you more advanced coding elements and lets you create increasingly complex code. Your objective is to automate harvesting as efficiently as possible.</p>
            <p>Players see the drone execute their code immediately, fueling frequent “aha!” moments. Working programmers especially love the direct visualization. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>The game explains each element step by step and lets you build your own code. There is also an information button in the top right corner if you have questions about the game.</p>

            <h2>History &amp; Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Made by Timon Herzog, an independent developer from Switzerland with a computer science background, known for The Farmer Was Replaced and Assembly Planter.</li>
                <li>The project began as a non Python like FarmDrone prototype and shifted toward a Python like language after players asked for a more authentic coding feel, while the title playfully suggests that your drone “replaces” the farmer by doing the work you code. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Early versions did not prioritize font/readability, color blind safety, or key remapping, which created additional work later. Localization has since become a priority to reach global audiences. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Unlike many programming games that focus purely on puzzles, this game combines simulation with an upgrade tree and incremental systems. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>A Mac version is in development (timeline to be announced). <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Beat the game to unlock a drone hat that’s basically the farmer’s skull. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
            </ul>
