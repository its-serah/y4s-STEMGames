            <h2>Why You’ll Love It</h2>
            <p>A detailed and engaging game that teaches you about cybersecurity and ethical hacking.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Concepts Explored</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A friendly explanation of advanced situations. It applies realistic cybersecurity knowledge and rules.</li>
                <li>Realism is anchored in core cybersecurity principles like terminal use, scripting your own tools, and basic networking, without teaching real attack techniques. To keep it approachable, methods are gamified and simplified; as players learn the loop, it feels friendlier. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Players build terminal fluency and foundational networking, practicing real style commands (<span class="mono">ls</span>, <span class="mono">cd</span>, <span class="mono">chmod</span>, <span class="mono">chown</span>, <span class="mono">mkdir</span>, <span class="mono">ssh</span>, <span class="mono">ftp</span>). <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Every tool is implemented in the game’s own scripting language, with readable/editable source. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>This hands on tinkering reinforces core concepts and accelerates learning. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learn:</strong> CyberSecurity / Ethical Hacking, plus terminal fluency and basic networking.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Cryptography, hacking, DDoS attacks, etc., including real style commands and reading/modifying command source.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Real challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage:</strong> Creativity / logical thinking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
            <p>You start with a beginner challenge of connecting to WiFi by hacking your way through it. Later, you get advanced challenges like retrieving data by hacking into a computer using real life tools and commands, including missions like hacking a school system to change a client’s grade.</p>
            <p>The founder acknowledges the steep learning curve, especially for newcomers to Linux or the command line. In version <span class="mono">v1.0</span> of the game, a tutorial rework will further ease onboarding. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></p>
            <p>An early “aha” moment comes from running ScanLan, which instantly visualizes the local network, devices and connections. Seeing the topology clarifies how LANs are structured and how hosts relate. Beginners quickly grasp navigation and plan pivots between devices. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>

            <h2>History &amp; Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Made by Loading Home, a single developer team led by Kurouzu from Spain.</li>
                <li>Kurouzu envisioned a shared universe powered by a simulated operating system, inspired by a long standing interest in MMORPGs and cybersecurity. He kept the persistence and systems depth but removed nonessential Unix complexity to make it approachable. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>This project was inspired by the classic hacking game Uplink, especially its “trace” mechanic from detection to attribution, as a core influence at earlier stages of development. The atmosphere and lore draw from movies like The Matrix and Mr. Robot. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Scripting is both the signature decision and the key reversal: what began as a non feature became indispensable through player feedback. Player scriptable tools now define the experience. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Fun quirk: an unexpected behavior in the <span class="mono">whois</span> command revealed admin details on player networks (mirroring NPC networks). The community found it compelling for sleuthing, leading the team to revert the fix and keep the dynamic in spirit. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Standout community creations include “Coins,” “Capture the Flag,” small games, bash replacements, and automation tools, many of which inspired integrated support. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Modding is limited in multiplayer to prevent cheating; single player supports small mods now, with plans to expand. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Community translations are available via Steam Workshop and are supported by the game. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
                <li>Version 1.0 is near; most roadmap features are complete. Remaining items are music/audio, a tutorial rework, and bug fixing. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>
            <p>Easter eggs are discoverable through exploration. Check in world details and NPC emails for intriguing leads. <span class="mono">[Interview, Oct 2025]</span></p>
