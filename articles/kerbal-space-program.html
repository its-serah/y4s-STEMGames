            <h2>Why You’ll Love It</h2>
            <p>If you’re interested in space, engineering, or just designing funny (and often explosive) vehicles, this game is for you. You can build your own aircraft or spacecraft and use them however you want. It is perfect for curious players who love to build, test, fail, and improve.</p>

            <h2>Scientific Concepts Explored</h2>
            <p>Kerbal Space Program introduces players to core principles of physics and aerospace engineering through a realistic simulation environment. As you design and launch spacecraft, you engage with aerodynamics, thrust, and the relationship between mass and acceleration. During flight you experience orbital mechanics, learning how gravity, velocity, and trajectory interact to form stable (or unstable) orbits. The game also emphasizes iterative engineering: test vehicles, observe real physical forces, and refine each design to improve performance.</p>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Basics of aerospace engineering &amp; rocketry.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Problem solving by designing and improving spacecraft.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Engineering based reasoning to interpret flight and adjust designs to achieve stable orbits and reliable mission performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage:</strong> Creativity and problem solving.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
            <p>You start in a space center where you can take contracts, hire astronauts, manufacture vehicles, make scientific progress in the research center, and track operations. Completing contracts rewards you with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Science points to unlock new technologies</li>
                <li>Funds to upgrade space center buildings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you progress, missions grow more complex, eventually leading to moon landings, space stations, and interplanetary exploration.</p>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>First you take a contract from mission control, then design a spacecraft to complete that mission.</p>
            <p>While building your rocket, check variables like center of gravity, center of thrust overlay, and aerodynamic overlay. After your vehicle is ready, organize its staging: which engines fire first, when fuel tanks detach, and how the spacecraft transitions between phases of flight.</p>
            <p>Completing contracts earns science points and funds, letting you unlock advanced technologies, upgrade buildings, and take on more ambitious missions. You can also use the KSP Wiki tutorial page to learn more about gameplay.</p>

            <h2>Community Voices</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“The most accessible space flight simulator in its realism class I've ever played. Ability to design own craft from preconfigured components rather than being limited to prepackaged craft is a huge draw. Support for air and land vehicles really rounds out the game's rich set of features. Warning: has potential to become an addictive time soak.” (Steam comment)</p>
